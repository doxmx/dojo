# Greed

Greed (Dice Game)

Write a class Greed with a `score()` method that accepts an array of die values (up to 6). Scoring rules are as follows:

- A single number one (100)
- A single number five (50)
- Triple number ones [1,1,1] (1000)
- Triple number twos [2,2,2] (200)
- Triple number threes [3,3,3] (300)
- Triple number fours [4,4,4] (400)
- Triple number fives [5,5,5] (500)
- Triple number sixes [6,6,6] (600)

Note that the scorer should work for any number of dice up to 6.

- Four-of-a-kind (Multiply Triple Score by 2)
- Five-of-a-kind (Multiply Triple Score by 4)
- Six-of-a-kind (Multiply Triple Score by 8)
- Three Pairs [2,2,3,3,4,4] (800)
- Straight [1,2,3,4,5,6] (1200)
